<h1>About me</h1>

<p>So who am I, one might ask? My name is Minenhle, an aspiring web developer, forklift operator and a very curious person. I love learning new things and as an aspiring developer; i love learning new stuff, how things work, especially websites and everything around it.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in a small township in Hammarsdale, west of Durban, South Africa. I consider myself as a tenacious, yet shy person who take pride of everything i do. I work as a forklift operator at Freys Food Brands in Cato Ridge. I finished my high school grades in 2014 and in 2024, i emnrolled for higher certificate in Information Technology because of the love i have for technology. One day I wanna become a software developer and my biggest dream is to become a web developer and build websites for start-up businesses.</p>

<p>I fell in love with websites since 2011 when I was still in high school and my interest started when i was first introduced to the internet and I fell in love immediately. I wanted to know how the internet works and i discovered that the more I found out, the more I wanted to learn, and that made me want to create a website for myself and create websites for other people to showcase their products and services they rendered to their customers online.</p>

<p>the main goal is to introduce start-ups to online hustling (e-commerce). My biggest dream is to help start-up and prospering businesses create an online platform to work for them 24/7, to help their businesses be known to the online world and not just word of mouth or social media pages, but across all internet and make websites for their products/services they offer as a home for their hustle.</p>
